# Store-data

ðŸ”¹ Project Aim:
The primary aim of this project was to design and implement a structured and scalable database system for managing store-related data, including product details, sales transactions, and customer records. The objective was to simulate a real-world retail store environment where data could be efficiently stored, queried, and analyzed to derive meaningful business insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features and Workflow:
Created a relational database schema to handle various aspects of store operations such as product inventory, customer information, and order tracking.

Designed and normalized multiple tables to minimize redundancy and ensure data consistency.

Used SQL Server to:

Define table structures with appropriate data types and constraints.

Insert sample data into the tables for simulation.

Write and execute various SQL queries for reporting and analysis (e.g., total sales, top-selling products, customer purchase history).

Structured datasets using Microsoft Excel for easy data preparation and migration into the SQL environment.

Demonstrated the importance of data integrity, foreign key relationships, and query optimization in a transactional database setup.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) â€“ for writing, testing, and executing SQL queries.

Microsoft Excel â€“ for data input, formatting, and simulation before import.

(Optional) Power BI â€“ for creating dashboards and visualizing key metrics like monthly sales and customer trends (include this only if you used it).

ðŸ”¹ Result and Outcome:
Successfully developed a functional database system capable of handling and retrieving store data efficiently.

Enabled dynamic querying of product and sales information, which could support reporting, performance analysis, and decision-making in a real retail environment.

Gained hands-on experience in database design, SQL query writing, and managing store operations from a data perspective.
